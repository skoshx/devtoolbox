# ðŸ§° DevToolbox
### Everything devs need for increasing productivity.

### Contributing
All contributions are welcome, however there are some style guidelines that you should follow. All tools should use Tailwind CSS classes to do as much of the styling as possible, this way the tools will share a similar design. You can use the already existing tools such as `Pomodoro` or `Weather` to get a starting point.

### TODO:
* Add ExpandableTool -> A tool where you can click on it to expand to show more information (can be useful, although generally we will try to accomplish everything using as little space as possible.)
* Finish animations -> Cards need to be able to be rearranged, in a way that is smoothly animated using spring based animations.
